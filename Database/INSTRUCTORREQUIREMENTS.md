You are encouraged to prepare the class by reading documents (slides, reading text,...), doing exercises, submitting the homework when required .... before coming to the classroom.
 
For assignments/homework, there are some specifics requirements (organization) and I will give the guideline in a separate post.
 
We will have regularly quick quiz (online) in the classroom, so if you can bring your device with Internet connection in the classroom, it would be great.
